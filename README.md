## Credits:

The original author of the script is [777PlayZ](https://github.com/777PlayZ "777PlayZ"). The code is not protected by a license, I have the right to copy and share it. L A W for the explanatory video on how to install it more thoroughly. And finally to [git-vscode](https://github.com/git-vscode "git-vscode") for updating the script.

- #### **Why did I copy the repo instead of sharing the author's?**
In case the author changes his original repo and puts a malicious program, I prefer to take the responsibility to copy the code.
